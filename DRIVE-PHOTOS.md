# Google Drive Photos — Handoff Note

**Folder:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F8iCL2_oF0KteBMKPrcO3IQveSfacTnb

## Status: not auto-importable (yet)

The folder's files are **not publicly shared / download-locked**. During the build I confirmed:

- Anonymous access (what a live site visitor gets) returns a Google **sign-in page**, not the image —
  so Drive direct links (`uc?id=…`, `lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/…`) would show **broken images** to the public.
- Authenticated download endpoint returned **403 Forbidden** (the Chrome session was on `authuser=1`).
- In-page `fetch` is CORS-blocked and `<canvas>` export is tainted, so the photos can't be pulled
  programmatically either.
- Changing the folder's sharing permissions is something **you need to do** (I don't modify access controls).

The site currently uses the client's Wix CDN photos (the same business's real images, publicly hosted),
so nothing is broken — these can be swapped once the Drive originals are accessible.

## To use the Drive originals — pick one:

1. **Make the folder public** ("Anyone with the link → Viewer"), confirm download is allowed, then I can
   import them, **OR**
2. **Download the folder** yourself and drop the files into `/images/`, then I'll wire them in, **OR**
3. Make sure Chrome's **default Google account** is the one with access (the 403 was on `authuser=1`).

Once accessible, the right approach is to **download into `/images/` and serve locally** (faster, reliable,
SEO-friendly) rather than hotlinking Drive.

The folder also contains **subfolders** with more photography (not yet enumerated):
`Pasta Class (Oct 7)`, `Pasta Class 2 (Oct 31)`, `Pasta Class 3`, `Photo generali Da Cecot`,
`food photos`, `Da decot Erica`. These would be ideal for the pasta-class / experiences pages.
